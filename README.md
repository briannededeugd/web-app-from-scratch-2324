# MY PERSONAL SITE - BRIANNE

Welcome to this interactive mini-site I built for the course Webapps From Scratch, meant to be a creative sort of introduction. In this work of mine, you'll find a pixelated version of me, surrounded by the things I feel introduce who I am as a person on a friendly surface-level, its style greatly inspired by infamous pixelated videogames like Stardew Valley, Pacman and Super Mario. Best viewed on a phone-format.
