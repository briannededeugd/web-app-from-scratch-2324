# MY PERSONAL SITE - BRIANNE

Welcome to this interactive mini-site I built for the course Webapps From Scratch, meant to be a creative sort of introduction. In this work of mine, you'll find a pixelated version of me, surrounded by the things I feel introduce who I am as a person on a surface-level. The application's style is greatly inspired by infamous pixelated videogames like Stardew Valley, Pacman and Super Mario, and it is best viewed on a phone-format.

<a id="howtoinstall"></a>

## How to Install
1. Navigate to the [Code](https://github.com/briannededeugd/web-app-from-scratch-2324) tab of this repository.
2. Click the green button that says `Code` at the top right of the files section.
3. At the bottom of the dropdown that appears, click `Download ZIP`.
4. Open your computer's Finder (or its alternative, dependent on your operating system) and navigate to the folder you've downloaded the ZIP into, this is usually `Downloads` by default.
5. Locate the newly downloaded ZIP (its name will be `web-app-from-scratch-2324`) and unpack it.
6. Find the file `index.html` in the unpacked ZIP's `docs` folder, right-click this file and open with Chrome or Firefox.

There you go, now you've installed the app! For a better experience, navigate to the `Inspector` (right-click in your browser, click `Inspector`) and select the little devices icon at the top right of the inspector window. Then, pick a phonescreen size for the best user experience.

## Features and use

## Process
I've received some great feedback during this process! Here's my process, including what my teachers and peers have had to say about improving my app.
1. To start out, I wrote simple HTML to position all elements and drew some containers and icons in Procreate. I wanted to go for a pixelated, 8-bit videogame style, because our theme as a team was videogames. The first thing I focused on was the 3D-element I was planning to implement. Various online sources on 3D CSS taught me the semantics of containers and elements needed to achieve the effect I was going for. My HTML is quite simple:

```html
<section class="rotation">
	<section class="avatar">
		<!-- BIOGRAPHY -->
		<div class="bio"></div>

		<!-- LEEFTIJD/LEVEL -->
		<div class="level"></div>

		<!-- SOUNDTRACK -->
		<div class="soundtrack"></div>

		<!-- NATIVE (TO) -->
		<div class="native"></div>

		<!-- STRENGTHS -->
		<div class="strengths"></div>
	</section>
</section>
```

Next, I applied the necessary CSS. Because I wanted my elements/categories to 'revolve' around me, I used a placeholder of a butterfly as its background image.

```css
.rotation {
    margin: 0;
    height: max-content;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    perspective: 800px; /* Adjust the perspective for the 3D effect */
    perspective-origin: center;
}

.avatar {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-image: url("../img/butterfly.png");

    background-size: cover;
    border-radius: 50%;
    position: relative;
    transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

.avatar > div {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    position: absolute;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
}

.avatar > div {
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transition: transform 1s ease-in-out; 
}

/* Bio */
.avatar > div:nth-child(1) {
    background: url("../img/bio.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    transform: translate(-50%, 100%) rotateY(0deg) translateZ(100px);
}

/* Level */
.avatar > div:nth-child(2) {
   background: url("../img/level.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
   transform: translate(-50%, 50%) rotateY(72deg) translateZ(100px);
}

/* ETC... */
```

It did seem a little strange that I had to keep adding `.avatar > div:nth-of-type(xx) {}` to apply the same styling multiple times, instead of defining the style once at `.avatar > div`, but unfortunately doing so didn't work. But the good news: the 3D-placing worked!

5. OTHER BUTTONS (NEXT, PREV, NAME)
6. The next and previous buttons as well as the names on the top should be easier to read / more obvious, so that they don't blend into the background too much and so that it's clear to the user that they can interact with the elements. Suggestion: perhaps add a 'light' around them, like a luminent glow that pixel games have sometimes. - Vasilis, February 8th<br/>

4.  The data of the 'Native' category can get pretty complex, because it's an array of objects of which I want the property key as well as the value in my frontend, but I only have one paragraph to fill. My issue was that the data was loading, but it only displayed the last object in the Native array. I fixed this by adding an empty string to accumulate the HTML content, so that each collected object could get added to the frontend, and the different objects got added up, rather than being replaced by each other. <br />

The issue and the code: <br/>
<img src="./docs/readme-img/oldnative.png" width="300px">

```js
const category = data[elementKey];
if (Array.isArray(category)) {
	console.log(category, "is an array");
	category.forEach((livingInfo) => {
		for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(livingInfo)) {
			console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
			infoText.textContent = `${key}: ${value}`;
		}
	});
	infoHeading.textContent = elementKey;
}
```

The fix and its code: </br>
<img src="./docs/readme-img/newnative.png" width="300px">

```js
if (Array.isArray(category)) {
			let fullHtml = ""; // Initialize an empty string to accumulate the HTML content
			category.forEach((livingInfo) => {
				for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(livingInfo)) {
					fullHtml += `${key}: ${value}<br />`; // Append each key-value pair with a line break
				}
			});
			infoText.innerHTML = fullHtml; // Set the innerHTML to include line breaks
		} else {
			infoText.textContent = category;
		}
```
