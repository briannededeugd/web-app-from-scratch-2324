# MY PERSONAL SITE - BRIANNE

Welcome to this interactive mini-site I built for the course Webapps From Scratch, meant to be a creative sort of introduction. In this work of mine, you'll find a pixelated version of me, surrounded by the things I feel introduce who I am as a person on a surface-level. The application's style is greatly inspired by infamous pixelated videogames like Stardew Valley, Pacman and Super Mario, and it is best viewed on a phone-format.

<a id="howtoinstall"></a>

## How to Install
1. Navigate to the [Code](https://github.com/briannededeugd/web-app-from-scratch-2324) tab of this repository.
2. Click the green button that says `Code` at the top right of the files section.
3. At the bottom of the dropdown that appears, click `Download ZIP`.
4. Open your computer's Finder (or its alternative, dependent on your operating system) and navigate to the folder you've downloaded the ZIP into, this is usually `Downloads` by default.
5. Locate the newly downloaded ZIP (its name will be `web-app-from-scratch-2324`) and unpack it.
6. Find the file `index.html` in the unpacked ZIP's `docs` folder, right-click this file and open with Chrome or Firefox.

There you go, now you've installed the app! For a better experience, navigate to the `Inspector` (right-click in your browser, click `Inspector`) and select the little devices icon at the top right of the inspector window. Then, pick a phonescreen size for the best user experience.

## Relevant feedback & process
I've received some great feedback during this process! Here's what my teachers and peers have had to say about improving my app.
1. The next and previous buttons as well as the names on the top should be easier to read / more obvious, so that they don't blend into the background too much and so that it's clear to the user that they can interact with the elements. Suggestion: perhaps add a 'light' around them, like a luminent glow that pixel games have sometimes. - Vasilis, February 8th<br/>

2.  The data of the 'Native' category can get pretty complex, because it's an array of objects of which I want the property key as well as the value in my frontend, but I only have one paragraph to fill. My issue was that the data was loading, but it only displayed the last object in the Native array. I fixed this by ... <br />

The issue and the code: <br/>
<img src="./docs/readme-img/oldnative.png" width="300px">

```js
const category = data[elementKey];
if (Array.isArray(category)) {
	console.log(category, "is an array");
	category.forEach((livingInfo) => {
		for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(livingInfo)) {
			console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
			infoText.textContent = `${key}: ${value}`;
		}
	});
	infoHeading.textContent = elementKey;
}
